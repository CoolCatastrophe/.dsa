Sure, here are some simple real-world examples of how queues are used:

1. **Supermarket Checkout**: In a supermarket, customers line up in a queue at the checkout counters. The customer at the front of the queue is served first, and as new customers arrive, they join the back of the queue.

2. **Printer Queue**: In a printer, print jobs are often managed using a queue. Print requests are added to the queue, and the printer processes them one by one in the order they were added.

3. **Bread Toaster**: When you're making breakfast and using a toaster, you put slices of bread into the toaster one by one. The toaster processes them in the order they were added, similar to a queue.

4. **Call Center**: In a call center, incoming customer calls are often placed in a queue. Agents attend to the calls in the order they arrived, ensuring fairness and orderliness.

5. **Online Ticket Booking**: When multiple users are trying to book tickets for an event online, their requests are often placed in a queue. The tickets are allocated based on the order of requests received.

6. **Bank Transactions**: In a bank, customers waiting to perform transactions like deposits or withdrawals form a queue. The next customer in line is served at the counter.

7. **Task Processing**: In a computer program or operating system, background tasks or jobs can be managed using a queue. Jobs are added to the queue and processed in the order they were added.

In all these examples, queues are used to manage tasks or items in a way that ensures fairness and follows the "first in, first out" (FIFO) principle, where the item added first is the one that's processed or served first.
